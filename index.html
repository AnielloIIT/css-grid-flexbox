        T-Mobile: T-mobile appears to be getting 
        the phone a bit later, as pre-orders will 
        begin on October 5th but sales won’t start until 
        the 13th. The price will be $80 down and 30 
        per month for 24 months, which means outright 
        pricing will be $800. It’s worth noting that the 
        V30 is the first T-Mobile phone to support Tmo’s 600Mhz 
        spectrum, which should give better performance in rural areas.

        There’s a lot to like about the LG V30, including
        beefy specs that are centered around a Snapdragon
        835 processor. There’s also a dual camera setup, 
        a new 18:9 FullVision display, and much more. But 
        you’re not here for the specs, you want to learn 
        more about where to buy the LG V30.
